                    Hi my name is Alison, I graduated from The University of Texas at Austin Coding Boot Camp Program in November 2023, where I learned how to build web applications using MySQL, Node.js, and other technologies. Since January 2023, I have been working as a shift supervisor at CVS Health, managing associates, time, and cash flow through POS systems.
                    In my current role, I have developed a strong understanding of how to lead and motivate a diverse team of employees, ensure customer satisfaction, and comply with company policies and procedures. I have also applied my coding skills to troubleshoot and improve the functionality and efficiency of the POS systems, creating a smoother and faster checkout process for both customers and associates. I am passionate about learning new skills and technologies, and I am eager to join an organization that values innovation, collaboration, and customer-centricity. I believe I can bring a unique perspective and experience to the team, as someone who has both technical and retail expertise, and who can adapt to different challenges and environments.
